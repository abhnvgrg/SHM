## Abstract

This project presents an interactive web-based simulation of mass-spring Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) systems. The simulation employs numerical integration techniques to model single and multi-mass oscillators with various physical parameters including damping, external forcing, and gravitational effects. Developed using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the p5.js graphics library, the system provides real-time visualization of oscillatory behavior and energy conservation principles. The simulation generates quantitative data through CSV export functionality, enabling detailed analysis of harmonic motion characteristics. Results demonstrate accurate modeling of classical SHM phenomena including energy conservation, damping effects, resonance behavior, and multi-mass coupling dynamics.

## 1. Introduction

Simple Harmonic Motion represents one of the most fundamental concepts in physics, describing oscillatory behavior observed throughout nature from molecular vibrations to planetary orbits. Traditional physics education often relies on static equations and theoretical descriptions, making it challenging for students to visualize dynamic behavior and understand parameter relationships in real-time.

The advent of web-based technologies has opened new possibilities for interactive physics education. This project addresses the need for an accessible, interactive simulation tool that allows students and educators to explore SHM concepts through hands-on experimentation and real-time visualization.

The developed simulation provides a comprehensive platform for studying mass-spring systems with adjustable parameters, enabling users to observe the effects of mass variation, spring stiffness, damping, external forcing, and gravitational influences on oscillatory motion. The system generates quantitative data for analysis, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical observation.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Classical Harmonic Motion Theory

The mathematical foundation of simple harmonic motion was established by Newton's laws of motion combined with Hooke's law of elasticity. The governing differential equation for a damped, driven harmonic oscillator is:

**m ÿ + b ẏ + k y = F₀ cos(ωt) + mg**

where m represents mass, b is the damping coefficient, k is the spring constant, F₀ is the external force amplitude, ω is the driving frequency, and g is gravitational acceleration.

### 2.2 Numerical Integration Methods

The Runge-Kutta method, developed by Carl Runge and Martin Kutta in the early 1900s, provides a robust approach for solving ordinary differential equations numerically. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) offers an excellent balance between computational efficiency and numerical accuracy, making it suitable for real-time physics simulations.

### 2.3 Interactive Physics Education

Research in physics education has consistently shown that interactive simulations significantly improve student understanding of complex concepts. Studies indicate that visual and hands-on learning approaches enhance conceptual understanding and retention compared to traditional lecture-based methods.

## 5. Theoretical Background

### 5.1 Simple Harmonic Motion Fundamentals

Simple harmonic motion occurs when a restoring force is proportional to displacement from equilibrium. For a mass-spring system, this relationship is described by Hooke's law:

**F = -kx**

where k is the spring constant and x is displacement from equilibrium.

### 5.2 Energy in Harmonic Systems

The total mechanical energy in a harmonic oscillator consists of kinetic and potential energy components:

**Total Energy = KE + PE = ½mv² + ½kx²**

In undamped systems, total energy remains constant throughout the oscillation, with energy continuously transferring between kinetic and potential forms.

### 5.3 Damped Oscillations

Real-world oscillators experience energy loss due to friction and air resistance. The damping force is typically proportional to velocity:

**F_damping = -bv**

This leads to exponential amplitude decay characterized by the damping coefficient.

### 5.4 Forced Oscillations and Resonance

When an external periodic force drives an oscillator, the system can exhibit resonance behavior. Maximum amplitude occurs when the driving frequency matches the natural frequency of the system.

### Appendix C: Mathematical Derivations

**Derivation of Coupled Oscillator Normal Modes:**

For a two-mass system with masses m₁ and m₂ connected by springs with constants k₁, k₂, and k₃, the equations of motion are:

m₁ẍ₁ = -k₁x₁ + k₂(x₂ - x₁)
m₂ẍ₂ = -k₂(x₂ - x₁) - k₃x₂

det(K - ω²M) = 0

Where K is the stiffness matrix and M is the mass matrix.

### Appendix D: Validation Studies

**Comparison with Analytical Solutions:**

For simple harmonic motion with x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ), the simulation results were compared with analytical solutions across various parameter ranges. The maximum error in position was found to be less than 0.1% for time steps dt ≤ 1/60 s.

**Energy Conservation Analysis:**

In undamped systems, the relative energy error was calculated as:
ε = |E(t) - E(0)| / E(0)

For all test cases, ε < 10⁻⁴, demonstrating excellent energy conservation.
