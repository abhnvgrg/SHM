# Mass-Spring SHM Simulation Project (Versions 1 to 6)

---

## Overview

This project simulates Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) of a mass-spring system using JavaScript and p5.js, evolving through six versions (v1–v6). It progressively enhances the physics modeling, visualization, user controls, and feature set, culminating in a rich interactive simulation with multiple masses, damping, nonlinear springs, external forces, and even a placeholder for quantum simulation.

## Version Progress Summary

### Version 1 — Basic Single Mass-Spring Oscillator

- **Features:**
  - Simulated a single mass attached to a spring using basic SHM equation \( m \ddot{y} + k y = 0 \).
  - Visualization included a simple mass block oscillating vertically on screen.

- **Limitations:**
  - No user controls or parameter adjustments.
  - No damping, forcing, or multiple masses.

- **Purpose:**
  - Proof of concept and visualization of fundamental SHM.

### Version 2 — User Input for Parameters

- **Features:**
  - Added HTML input fields for mass (m) and spring constant (k).
  - Users could now adjust these parameters dynamically.
  - Visualization updated accordingly.

- **Limitations:**
  - Still limited to a single mass.
  - No damping or forcing yet.

- **Improvements:**
  - Introduced basic UI, making the simulation interactive.

### Version 3 — Inclusion of Damping and External Forcing

- **Features:**
  - Added damping coefficient (b) input.
  - Added external periodic forcing: force amplitude \( F_0 \) and frequency \( \omega \).
  - Equation extended to \( m \ddot{y} + b \dot{y} + k y = F_0 \cos(\omega t) \).

- **Improvements:**
  - More realistic physics: energy dissipation and driven oscillations.

- **Visualization:**
  - Oscillation amplitude responded dynamically to damping and forcing parameters.

---

### Version 4 — Multiple Masses and Springs (Mass Chain)

- **Features:**
  - Allowed simulation of multiple masses connected in series by springs (up to 4 masses).
  - Implemented system of coupled differential equations.
  - Used numerical integration (Runge-Kutta 4) for time evolution of the system.

- **Improvements:**
  - More complex and realistic physics, including interactions between masses.
  - Extended visualization to display multiple masses and springs dynamically.

- **Challenges:**
  - Increased computational complexity.
  - Visual representation of springs with sinusoidal wave shape for better aesthetics.

### Version 5 — Nonlinear Spring and Gravity Effects

- **Features:**
  - Added option to enable nonlinear spring behavior via cubic term with coefficient \( \alpha \).
  - Added gravity effect based on selectable celestial bodies (Earth, Moon, Mars, etc.).
  - Updated forces and equations accordingly: nonlinear restoring force and gravitational potential included.

- **Improvements:**
  - Significantly enriched the physical realism of the simulation.
  - Users can explore non-ideal spring behavior and environmental gravity differences.

- **Visualization:**
  - Added graphs for position vs. time and energy components (kinetic, spring potential, gravitational potential).

### Version 6 — Final Refinements and Additional Features

- **Features:**
  - Polished UI and styling for user-friendly control panel sidebar.
  - Added simulation mode selector with placeholder for "Quantum" mode (non-functional but prepared).
  - Energy graphs improved and color-coded for clarity.
  - Added data export feature (CSV) for position and energy data over time.
  - Displayed real-time equation and status of each mass (position and velocity).
  - Enabled restart functionality to update simulation with new parameters instantly.

- **Technical Improvements:**
  - Refined RK4 integration implementation for system of masses.
  - Optimized performance with history trimming to keep graph data manageable.
  - Enhanced spring visualization with sinusoidal waves between masses for aesthetics.

- **User Experience:**
  - Responsive layout with sidebar and main canvas area.
  - Intuitive controls for physics parameters, nonlinearities, and gravity environment.
  - Real-time feedback with equations and status readouts.

- **Limitations:**
  - Quantum mode not yet implemented.
  - Export limited to classical mode data.

## General Technical Notes

- **Physics Modeling:**
  - The simulation models vertical motion of masses connected by springs under Newtonian mechanics.
  - Incorporates damping and external forcing.
  - Nonlinear restoring forces modeled by adding cubic terms to spring force.
  - Gravity modeled as constant acceleration depending on selected celestial body.

- **Numerical Integration:**
  - Fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method used for numerical stability and accuracy.
  - State vector includes position and velocity of all masses.
  - Forces computed at each time step for integration.

- **Visualization:**
  - p5.js handles rendering, including springs as sinusoidal curves and masses as rectangles.
  - Graphs for displacement and energies provide insight into system dynamics.

- **UI:**
  - HTML and CSS create a fixed-width sidebar for controls and main canvas for visualization.
  - Inputs include numeric fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, and buttons.
  - Real-time updates triggered on parameter changes and restart button.

- **Data Export:**
  - Simulation data (time, position, kinetic, potential energies) exportable as CSV for further analysis.

## How to Use (v6)

1. Adjust parameters in the sidebar:
   - Choose simulation mode (currently only classical works).
   - Select number of masses (1-4).
   - Set mass, spring constant, damping coefficient, external force amplitude and frequency.
   - Enable nonlinear spring and set nonlinear coefficient if desired.
   - Select gravity environment from dropdown.
   - Set quantum number n (placeholder).

2. Click **Restart Simulation** to apply new settings.

3. Observe the simulation animation and energy graphs.

4. Optionally, click **Export CSV** to save data from the classical simulation.

## Conclusion

This project progressively builds from a simple single-mass SHM model into a flexible, interactive multi-mass nonlinear spring system simulator with realistic physics and user-friendly controls. The final version (v6) balances complexity and usability, providing a rich educational tool for visualizing and analyzing mass-spring dynamics under various physical conditions.
