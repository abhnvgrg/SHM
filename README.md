# Mass-Spring Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a mass-spring system exhibiting simple harmonic motion (SHM). It numerically solves the systemâ€™s differential equations using the Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4) method for accurate time evolution. The simulation is visualized using p5.js and features interactive UI controls for various physical parameters.

The project evolved through six versions, each adding features, improving numerical methods, and enhancing visualization and user experience.
